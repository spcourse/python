    "# Dictionary practice \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python that allow you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs. They are incredibly powerful and versatile, and are widely used in a variety of programming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning how to use dictionaries is important because they allow you to represent complex relationships and data structures in a simple and intuitive way. Dictionaries are also very efficient for certain operations, such as looking up the value associated with a given key. They have a time complexity of O(1) for these operations, which means that they are very fast even for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will practice using dictionaries in Python, and get a quick overview of the different ways in which they can be used to solve a variety of programming problems.\n",

    "## Counting using a list\n",

The function `count_occurrences` counts the occurrences of each bird species in a given `bird_list`, and returns a list of lists where each sub-list contains two elements: the bird species, and its corresponding count."
