# Step 5: Checking `checkpy` and downloading tests

To help you verify whether a program functions in compliance with the specifications of an assignment, we have written a program of our own called **checkpy**. This program was installed in our environment in the previous steps. In addition to `checkpy` we also need the tests that correspond to the assignments that you'll have to make. These tests can be downloaded by executing the following command in the terminal:

    checkpy -d spcourse/tests

> If the `checkpy` command is not recognized, make sure that you are in the `(SP)` environment. If this is the case, and the command is still not working, you can run `pip install checkpy` to install checkpy manually.
