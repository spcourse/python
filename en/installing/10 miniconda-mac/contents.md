# Step 1: Miniconda

This package can be downloaded from the [Anaconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you're using a newer Mac with an M-chip you'll need [this](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.pkg) version, otherwise the Intel x86 version can be found [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg).
_Not sure? Open the Apple menu and choose "About This Mac" to check you processor type._

As soon as the download is finished execute the downloaded file. Follow the installation instructions of the program. You do not have to alter any of the options.

The installation might take a while.
