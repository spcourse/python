# Installing Python

Installing Python on your own computer on [macOS](/python/en/installing/computer/mac) or [Windows](/python/en/installing/computer/windows) is quick and useful. You can run Python anytime, even on the train! It's also great to have Python installed so you can use it when you have finished the course.

We recommend installing Python on your own computer, but in some cases this will lead to hard-to-solve problems. Are you completely stuck? Don't hesitate to send us an [email](mailto:minorai@mprog.nl) so we can help you along.

## Already have Python?

We still recommend you to go through the installation instructions above. We've added a couple of our own programs and some extra libraries to the installation process that will ensure you have everything installed for the rest of our courses!
